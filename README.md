# Sophia Dignam

Viola and violin session musician website.

## Hosting and Domain

Hosted on Vercel with custom domain registered with Cloudflare

## Email

Cloudflare offer free Email Routing. I've set it up so that any email to `contact@sophiadignam.co.uk` gets routed to her Gmail account. This has the benefit of hiding her personal email online whilst looking professional, and removes the need to open a separate mailbox.

To respond with `contact@sophiadignam.co.uk`, I've used Postmark to sign the domain and added the appropriate DNS records to Cloudflare.
